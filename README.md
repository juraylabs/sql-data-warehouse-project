# 🚀 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution — from ingesting raw source data to delivering SQL-driven business insights. It is designed as a hands-on implementation that reflects industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project is structured around two core components:

1. **Data Engineering** – Designing and building a modern data warehouse  
2. **Data Analytics & BI** – Generating actionable insights through SQL-based analysis

---

## 🏗️ Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** to consolidate sales data and support analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
- **Data Sources**  
  Import data from two source systems:
  - ERP system (CSV files)
  - CRM system (CSV files)

- **Data Quality**  
  Cleanse, validate, and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.

- **Integration**  
  Combine both source systems into a unified, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries.

- **Scope**  
  - Focus on the latest available dataset  
  - Historical data tracking is intentionally out of scope

- **Documentation**  
  Provide clear and concise documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
